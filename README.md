Simple bot. Just a test and a place for me to build my programing skills.

Goals:
-Modular input
-Modular output
-Debugging options
-Standard logging options
-Differentiate between other bots and users
-No figurative language
-As literal as possible
-IRC I/O
-Terminal I/O
-Developes trust
--Does not start with trust. Must earn

Possible Goals:
-Talk to bots without IRC headers (With IRC I/O)
-Persistance
